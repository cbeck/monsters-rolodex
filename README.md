This is just a fun little project I did while working on a React mastery course. It's quite simple, pulling in data from [a json sample site](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users), grabbing monster images from [robohash](https://robohash.org), and allowing you to filter them down by name.

It is available [here](https://cbeck.github.io/monsters-rolodex/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Working on more React projects now. Stay tuned...
